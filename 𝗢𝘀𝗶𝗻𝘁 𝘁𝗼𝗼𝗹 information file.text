1. Deep Learning for Data Classification and Entity Recognition

Integrate deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP) to classify search results based on entities like emails, credentials, IPs, or personal information.

Use libraries like SpaCy or transformers to detect and categorize personal, organizational, or geographic information automatically.


2. Live Monitoring and Auto-Detection of Changes

Set up continuous monitoring of specific queries or keywords and notify users of changes in search results.

Include a version control system to log differences between previous and current data, so users can track modifications over time.


3. Browser Automation for Captcha and Dynamic Content Handling

Integrate Selenium or Playwright to simulate user actions in the browser and handle captchas or JavaScript-heavy pages.

This feature will help extract content from sites that load data dynamically, enhancing search result accuracy.


4. Database Integration with Elasticsearch

Use Elasticsearch to store and index search results, enabling real-time and full-text searches with rapid querying.

This allows users to search within results based on keywords, filter by specific categories, and perform more in-depth analysis.


5. Graph Analysis for Relationship Mapping

Integrate graph database tools like Neo4j to map relationships between discovered entities (e.g., emails, social media profiles).

This feature is particularly useful for visualizing connections between various data points in OSINT investigations.


6. Modular API Integrations for Enhanced Enrichment

Allow users to plug in various enrichment APIs dynamically (Shodan, Censys, WhoisXML API, etc.) to enrich data about IPs, domains, and social accounts.

By adding modules, users can enrich OSINT results with deep data, vulnerability insights, and threat intelligence.


7. PDF and OCR Parsing

Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract to extract data from PDF or image-based search results.

This allows the tool to handle scanned documents or images and pull textual content from non-standard file types.


8. Enhanced Reporting and Visualization

Build interactive charts, graphs, and heatmaps within the HTML report to provide visual insights into collected data.

Enable CSV and JSON exports for integration with other data analysis tools.


9. Machine Learning for Content Ranking

Train a machine learning model to prioritize high-value results based on keywords, relevance, and content type.

This can help filter out irrelevant or low-quality pages, saving time during the analysis phase.


10. Multithreading with Smart Queuing and Error Recovery

Implement a smart queuing system that dynamically adjusts the number of concurrent threads based on system load.

Add error recovery to automatically retry failed requests and maintain a log of skipped or problematic URLs.
